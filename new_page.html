Bootcamp 2021: Geomoetric animation
In my project I started with a simple sketch which displayed a single origin ellipse and I moved this origin (0,0) to the center of the window
After this I made a for loop to rotate the line and used the values of X and Y to showcase movement with sine
I then used ellipses to design the end points of the lines to enhance the animation
Then I changed the sizes, fill and stroke which made the animation look much more alive
After changing sine for cosine I introduced a brief introduction effect
Lastly I used random colours in fill to genererate a range of different colours in the animation when the sketch ran to make it look more appealing.
